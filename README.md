# Face-Detection-on-Video-Stream-from-DJI-Tello-Drone-Python-OpenCV-Dlib-
Description: The goal of the project was to develop software capable of detecting human faces in real time on video streamed from a DJI Tello drone. Two detection methods were implemented and compared: Haar Cascades (OpenCV) and the HOG + SVM detector (Dlib).
